# Weekly is enough: 126 park polygons change rarely, and the City's service

# toronto-parks-layer's Monday slot, so the two never drive tippecanoe in the
# same WSL instance at once.

# run by 18:00 rather than a seven-day gap -- which is what a dead resolver
# cost the Toronto sibling on 2026-07-27. Still clear of the 23:00 quiet window.

# It also exits 70 when no Overpass mirror answered and the gap page had to fall

# the tiles; without it, two 504s in Aug 2026 left the page a fortnight stale
# with the task reporting success both times.
