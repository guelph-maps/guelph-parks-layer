"""Configuration constants for the Guelph parks tile layer build.

Single source of truth. No logic here.

Sibling of toronto-parks-layer: the same pipeline (download -> slim -> compare
-> vector + raster -> site -> publish), pointed at the City of Guelph Park
Boundary layer instead of Toronto's Green Spaces. The one structural difference
is the source -- Toronto publishes a static GeoJSON on CKAN, Guelph an ArcGIS
FeatureServer that has to be queried. Everything downstream of download.py is
the Toronto code with Guelph constants.
