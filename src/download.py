"""Download the Guelph Park Boundary GeoJSON from the City's ArcGIS service.

This is the one step that differs structurally from the toronto-parks-layer
template. Toronto downloads a static file from CKAN and smart-caches it on a
HEAD request: Last-Modified plus Content-Length against a small JSON sidecar.
Guelph publishes an ArcGIS FeatureServer, and a `/query` endpoint has neither
of those -- it is generated per request, so Last-Modified is the moment you
asked and Content-Length varies with nothing but the query.

So the cache key changes and nothing else does. The body is ~1.5 MB, cheap
enough to fetch every time; what is compared is a **sha256 of the response**.
Identical hash means the City has not touched the layer, and the existing dated
file is kept -- which also keeps DATA_DATE meaning "when the City data last
changed" rather than "when the build last ran", exactly as the Last-Modified
filename does for Toronto.

The output contract is unchanged: one dated GeoJSON FeatureCollection in data/,
which is all `slim` and the rest of the pipeline know about.

Every request is gated on a usable link first (``addressvault.net``, the same
gate the address vault pulls behind). The weekly trigger is what makes that
worth doing: a run lost to a dead link is not retried until next Monday.
